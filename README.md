## Installation

Proceed with a normal [installation of a plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157?u=falco).


## After Installation

You need to fill Client ID and Client Secret on Settings -> Plugins.

To get those values you must have a [Creator account first](https://www.patreon.com/become-a-patreon-creator).

Then go to [Clients & API Keys](https://www.patreon.com/platform/documentation/clients) and fill the necessary info.

> The Redirect URIs must be http://<DISCOURSE BASE URL>/auth/patreon/callback, like https://meta.discourse.org/auth/patreon/callback

Then you use the Client ID and Client Secret to configure the plugin.

## Group Sync

If you want to give your patrons a special treatment on your board, you can fill the `patreon creator access token` and `patreon sync patrons to group` so your patrons get automatic membership in a Discourse groups created by you.
This can pave the way to grant category access, titles and custom css to please your patrons!

## About

This is a work in progress! Feel free to use and ask questions here, or on [Meta](https://meta.discourse.org).

## TODO

- Create a catch-all reward group
- Button to invite patrons who aren't on Discourse yet.
